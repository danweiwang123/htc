## Harbord Tutoring Club

A small program of keeping track of volunteer hours and tutors.
<br/>
I built this program to help out my school's tutoring club ðŸ˜ƒ

## Running Harbord Tutoring Club (HTC)

### Downloading the source code

#### Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tRieMeRalD/htc.git
cd htc
```

#### To run HTC:

```
cd htc
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ../
npm run dev
```

## What is does (functionalities):
#### Landing Page
- Be able to view the tutors (name didn't want to be disclosed), 
the subjects they teach, their grade, and number of absences (to ensure
you're picking a tutor that committed to your success)

#### Volunteer Hour Log
- It's very hard to keep track of an accurate list of hours. This allows 
the exec team to easily manage all the hours and update the total count 
in real-time without any human errors.

#### Admin/Exec Dashboard
- This page allows the teachers and executive team to manage all the tutors
and to ensure the integrity of the hours being recorded
- We can easily store the history of previous tutors for any purpose needed (
the tabs "2020/2021" get updated right at the start of the school year, 
automatically)

#### Add Tutor
- Pick between the grades (9-12) and your availability (Tues/Thurs)
